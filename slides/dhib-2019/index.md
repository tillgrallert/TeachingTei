# An ambitious plan:

We have five hours for:

- a [brief introduction to mark-up, XML, and TEI](dhib-2019_1-introduction-tei.html)
- a [discussion of the applicability of TEI and XML to rtl-languages, predominantly Arabic](dhib-2019_2-tei-arabic.html)


The slides are available at [https://www.github.com/tillgrallert/TeachingTei/slides/dhib-2019/](https://www.github.com/tillgrallert/TeachingTei/slides/dhib-2019/index.html).
