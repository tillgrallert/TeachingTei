                  The author of "Morroco as it is" had, as leader of his caravan, a man named
                     Salem, who styled himself the khalifa, or second in command, This man had a
                     small English vocabulary, and one day surprised the traveller with an
                     unexpected display of borrowed patriotism
                  The party had stoppedn in the midst of a boar hunt to take luncheons, and as
                     they were sitting on the mountain side, overlooking the sea, the khalifa
                     suddely prposed the toast of "The Star Spangled Banner."

                  At the U.S. Immigration Bureau the steamer
                        Cyntiana whitch sailed from
                        Beyrouth on the 29th of
                        March arrived Monday evening, April the 24th,
                        at 7 P.M. She brought over 12 first-class passengers and 262 steerage
                     including the horsemen, performers and attendants of the Hamidieh
                        Hipodrome Company to which we made reference in out last issue,
                     promissing to write a special article on its arrival.
                  From the conversation held with one of the company's representatives we come to
                      to the conclusion that never in the history of this country has such a
                     collection of specialists, men, and women of real Arabian horses, camels and
                     dromedaries, been seen on this side of the Atlantic.

                  الشرق في معرض شيكاغو
                  The orient at fair.
                  Is there anybody left in Syria,
                        Egypt,
                     Turkey, Morocco, and the other
                     countries of the Orient? Were the questions asked by officers at
                        Ellis Island and the Orientals of New
                        York within the last few weeks. The long expected
                     concessioners, exhibitors and participants in the World's
                        Fair, who for many days and weeks have been directing their
                     footsteps from the various lands of the rising sun towards the "new
                     land of promise" have arrived in large numbers, and set foot upon the
                     soil of the new world which they have sought with feelings of high
                     expectation, and an eagerness to which long distance had added many
                     charms. The Sheikh who from childhood hours had learned to praise
                     Allah for every blessing of life, must have shouted a hearty
                        "Alhamdulila! and Allah Kariem!" when after a
                     journey of some weeks and months by land and by sea he saw in
                        New York harbor the majestic form of the Goddess
                     of Liberty with the beacon of light in her outstretched hand bidding
                     him welcome to the "home of the brave and the land of the
                        free."
                  Never in the history of the world has the East manifested its interest in the
                     West to such an extent as has been evidenced since the inauguration of the
                     ideas and plans of establishing an International Exposition in the city of
                        Chicago.
                  A great and restless wave of enthusiasm has swept over the Orient and turned
                     its attention towards America, the land of gigantic
                     realities in such a manner as has never been known before, what is very queer
                     and interesting to notice is that all Orientals come here with the hope of
                     making fortunes sufficiently large to insure them against poverty for the rest
                     of their lives.
                  Several of them who have tasted the "sweets" of financial prosperity at the
                        Paris Exposition, have doubled their energies and
                     efforts for excelling their exhibits and sections in the French capital. The
                     result is that the countries of the Orient have made a better and more
                     extensive showing at Chicago than they have done in any
                     exposition before.
                  We mentioned before brief notices in our former issue about the various
                     Oriental attractions intended for the World's Fair. We spoke
                     briefly of the various troupes which were on the way to this country. Today we
                     desire to announce the arrival and give few pertinent facts of what we haev
                     learned from the leaders and managers of those troupes which passed recently at
                     the U.S. Immigration Bureau.
                  The Turkish section of which Messrs. Sadullah,
                        Suhamy and Bistani are
                     concessioners have received many new additions and reinforcements among which
                     may be mentioned the 23 Persians who came recently with Mr. Khalil
                        Jureydini, and who will represent in the Persian section under
                     the auspices of the above mentioned Turkish concessioners, the customs and
                     manners of the land of the Shahs. A restaurant and a mangificently embroidered
                     tent which was used by one of the great rulers of that country, and which
                        Messrs. Mussallam Bros. &amp; Co.
                     have secured for exhibition purposes, will form part of the Persian
                     section.
                  The Oriental Theatre Company numbering 54 people, and under
                     the direction of Mr. Butros Tanfous arrived this week at
                     the U.S. Immigration Bureau. Several Oriental specialists
                     from various parts of Turkey have been secured in order to give the American
                     public a correct idea of the customs and manners of the people in different
                     parts of the Empire.
                  The members of the company have taken special pains for accurate reproduction
                     of "Eastern Life." The famous Arabic composer and actor Sheikh Abou
                        Khalil Kabany has the stage management of the plays and pieces
                     which are to be presented to World's Fair visitors in true and beautiful
                     Oriental style. We understand that people from
                     Bethlehem, Jerusalem,
                        Mt. Lebanon, Constantinople,
                        Anatolia, Arabia,
                        Syria and Palestine will take
                     part in the performance of the Oriental Theatre of the
                     Turkish section.
                  Cafe life amusements, social gatherings, singing, dancing, etc. will be very
                     extensively illustrated by the Oriental Cafe Company whose
                     personel arrived from Beyrouth this week. From a
                     conversation with Messrs. Korani,
                        Fadel and Jureydini we understood
                     that their preparations are very complete in every respect for taking good care
                     of those who would like to get an idea of how a cup of real Turkish coffee
                     tastes. They selected the very best Oriental furnishing and decorations for
                     their establishment. They imported a beautiful stage inlaid with mother of
                     pearls on which their singers, dancers and performers would appear. Ther
                     services of the sweet singer and graceful danseuse, Rugina
                        Beress of Damascus, who will be aided by
                     her troupe of several male and female artists, in realizing before the visitors
                     the pleasures, amusements and entertainments of cafe life were secured.
                  The Algerian section had 42 people, comprising athletes, tumblers, artists,
                     singers, dancers, artisans, etc., who passed in the U.S. Immigration
                        Bureau. They will give performances in the two theatres which
                        Mr. Ganon has prepared for his section. The Kabyle
                     performers will be assisted by some very beautiful lady dancers and singers
                     from the Sahara Desert.
                  Some of the wonderful Siawes from Morocco will take part
                     in this part of the entertainments. We learn from one of the invited guests,
                     who recently attended Mr. Ganon's Oriental banquet, that
                     the "tout ensemble" of his section presents a magnificient and beautiful
                     appearance.
                  The Egyptian section must appear very lively now with the 200 people who
                     recently came to this country with the S.S. Guildhall. Among
                     its interesting sights may be mentioned the Temple which represents the
                     architecture and decorations of the period of Ramses the
                        II. The 18 donkeys will do good service in carrying the people
                     from one end to the other in the "Rue de Caire," and vie
                     with the stalwart men carriers of the Sedan chairs in the Turkish section which
                     will be used for the illustration of the mode of travel in
                        Turkey.
                  The Chinese village will be fair specimen of the towns and cities of the
                        Flowery Kingdom. A restaurant, a tea establishment, a
                     theatre, and several silk shops will comprise some of its attractions.
                  The Celestials who numbered 400 persons destined for the Fair were detained in
                        San Francisco, and had a very hard time in trying to
                     satisfy the customs officers that they do not come within the provisions of the
                     Chinese exclusion, which prohibits the lanidng of Chinamen in the
                        United States. Their large number coming as they did
                     in one ship aroused the suspicions of the authorities, and they suppose that
                     several celestials have profited by this occasion, and came as exhibitors to
                     the World's Fair. From all accounts we can safely predict
                     that the Chinese section will not be behind the others in the line of Oriental
                     splendor and beauty of decoration.
                  The Malays whose coming to New York we have recently
                     announced are still detained on Ellis Island.
                        Sultan Jawhar will not make a very good showing of the
                     life, customs, industries and civilization of his people if his agent does not
                     hurry up and take his people from the U.S. Immigration
                        Bureau and put them right to work on the bamboo houses and palm
                     leave huts of his village in Midway Plaisance.
                  The Japanese whose progressiveness has attracted particular attention within
                     recent years will be very well represented during the World's
                        Fair. Many rich New Yorkers intend to eat out of their restaurant
                     and enjoy their tea parties at the exposition. 
                  In addition to the above mentioned Oriental attractions to be seen at
                        Midway Plaisance there are others which will be
                     outside of the Exposition grounds proper. There will be for instance a tourist
                     encampment such as would illustrate the tourists life and mode of tavels in the
                        Holy Land. Messrs.
                           Wardy &amp; Co., the contractors from
                        Beyrouth, have brought with them several tents and
                     performers who would reproduce before the visitors notionly the tent travel and
                     life of the American and European tourists who visit
                        Egypt, Syria and
                        Palestine, but also give an idea of the most
                     interesting things that the tourists see in those historical countries. Among
                     the people whom Mr. Wardy has brought are one or
                        Two Syrian wrestlers, and several musicians, singers, cooks,
                      waiters, etc. who will give series of entertainments in a cafe house
                     secured for the purpose. 
                  There is also the Hamidieh Hippodrome Company with her 40
                     Arabian horses, several camels, donkeys, etc., who will arrived at
                     this port on the 24th of this month. Their exhibitions no doubt
                     will be interesting, and we reserve writing a special article in the near
                     future about the personel and exihibits of this company.
                  All in all the East will be well represented in Chicago,
                     during the coming seven months. We hope that all of our countrymen and fellow
                     Orientals who will take part in it will realize from it their highest
                     expectations.
