                        February (the last day of the old Julian calendar). The Gregorian calendar
                        suppresses this rule in centesimal years that cannot be divided by 400. This
                        difference creates a growing offset between Gregorian and Julian calendars:
                        while 1900 R was a leap year, 1900 was not, which in turn caused the
                        difference between the Gregorian calendar, on the one hand, and the
                            <hi>mālī</hi> and <hi>rūmī</hi> calendars, on the other, to grow from 12
                        to 13 days from 29 Shubāṭ (February) 1900 R / 1315 M (13 March 1900)

                        calendar beginning the Year with 1 March. Introduced as fiscal calendar in
                        1676 and in the Ottoman context usually referred to as <hi>mālī</hi> and
                        sometimes, confusingly, also as <hi>rūmī</hi>. Every 33 lunar years, a
                            <hi>hijrī</hi> year would complete within a single solar <hi>mālī</hi>
                        year. In this case the counting of the <hi>mālī</hi> years skipped a year to
                        catch up with the faster <hi>hijrī</hi> calendar. Due to a printing error in
                        the coupon booklets for the consolidated debt repayment program for 1872
                        (1288 M instead of 1289 M), synchronisation of <hi>mālī</hi> and
                            <hi>hijrī</hi> years was henceforth abolished. As <hi>mālī</hi> years
                        began with 1 March, <hi>mālī</hi> leap years preceded their <hi>rūmī</hi>

                            of the public who hardly understand the situation or appreciate the

                    <p>Five general meetings were held in honour of the Constitution four of which
                        in two public gardens attended by several thousands of spectators including
                        the Vali and the three Mushirs now in Damascus, and one in a large theatre;
                        these meetings were given by provisional societies, military and civil, and
                        on each occasion more than a dozen speeches were delivered by various
                        speakers of liberal views, which were almost without exception temperate and
                        conducive to allay excitement.</p>
                    <p>Army officers started a club under the name of ‘<orgName>Liberty</orgName>’
                        and inaugurated it on the <date>10th instant</date>; one of the conditions
                        for joining the club being supporting the Constitution; and the membership
                        may be granted to worthy civilians also. The members amount now to more than
                        a hundred officers who joined in the last two days.</p>
                    <p>The liberal civilians are now forming another club with nearly similar
                        conditions as those of the <pb/> of the “<orgName>Liberty Club</orgName>”
                        and undoubtedly most of the chief notables will join it.</p>
                    <p>No serious steps have been taken as yet on any side towards the elections for
                        the Parliament but the clubs above mentioned intend to give their influence
                        for the choice of competent persons who are not yet indicated.</p>
                    <p>The <orgName>Union &amp; Progress Society</orgName>, whose individual members
                        can only be conjectend [?] vaguely here, is practically directed[?], the
                        Government gestation, military and administration in a prudent and energetic
                        way. The Vali at the Society’s demand began on the <date>10th instant</date>
                        to dismiss or compel resignation of corrupt and mischievous officials such
                        as the the Chief of Police <persName>Oman Jamal</persName>, <persName>Said
                            Effendi Banna</persName>, the Muhassebji, the Caim.ms of
                            <placeName>Douma</placeName>, <placeName>Zibadan</placeName> &amp;
                            <placeName>Dera’a</placeName> Cazas, the last being a cousin of
                            <persName>Izzet Pasha</persName>. The Alai Bey of Gendarmerie is also
                        likely to be dismissed with a particularly corrupt <persName>Major Ahmed
                            Bey</persName> of the Zaptiehs and several other functionaries of ill
                        repute will be in similar case [?], for the <pb/> the society intend to
                        improve the government departments gradually so as to replace the old
                        corrupt system by a new hones set of officials who are not to be found at
                        once.</p>
                    <p>There is some discontent on the part of the ulema and certain leaders in town
                        for the <orgName>Union &amp; Progress Society</orgName>, is going forward in
                        its own way and removing officials without consulting them, but there seem
                        no reason to fear that such discontent might provoke any substantial
                        resistance, at present.</p>
                    <p><persName>Izzet Pasha</persName>’s partisans and creatures here are not few,
                        but, having the public sentiments against them, they are rather afraid for
                        their own safety and trying to gain as many liberal friends as possible.</p>
                    <p>It is a good <sic>things</sic> that the demonstrations &amp; calling together
                        of crowds are now at an end for it is evident that the loss of the <pb/>
                        prestige o the government and the palpable decrease of its influence might
                        easily afford an opportunity for malcontents to provoke disturbance and
                        cause trouble in order to show the bad results of the liberal views.</p>
                    <p>It is true that there are no symptoms of animosity here between Moslems and
                        Christians but, as is always the case when the government power relaxes and
                        the public order endangered the weaker element would be the actual sufferer.
                        For this reason the Christians and Jews here rather felt a certain amount of
                        anxiety during the last fortnight, but the liberal chiefs among Moslems have
                        been all the time preaching equality and emphasising the necessity of order
                        and good behaviour.</p>
                    <p>As to the effect of promulgating the constitution in the other towns of this
                        Vilayet, very little can be said, for the people of the <pb/>
                        <placeName>Hauran</placeName> and <placeName>Kerak</placeName> Sanjak are
                        too ignorant to appreciate the difference between autocratic and
                        constitutional government” […]</p>
                    <p><del> In conclusion, I might add here that a pessimistic observer does not
                            fail to see some faint reasons for anxiety in Damascus and would, but
                            not without hesitation, foretell the rise of antagonistic parties who
                            might deal with each other corporally and endanger the public security.
                            The garrison of the town, I am sorry to say, is rather too small to cope
                            with such emergencies if they would ever come to action </del>
                        <add>Trouble so easily arises out of small incidents, e.g. the Bab Tuma
                            tumult (v. No. 30 of Aug 2/07[?]) or again the death of a policeman in
                            1902 that one cannot but feel some slight uneasiness without being
                            unduly pessimistic. Then again the conditions of the city are very
                            dissimilar from those of most others, in having here great notables of
                            various classes, races, &amp; ideas, accustomed to influence and power;
                            and there is a <pb/>
                        </add> new element in the presence of the <orgName>Hamidiyye
                            troops</orgName> still in temporary camp here the wide +rambling extent
                        of the town with the relative fewness of troops in garrison, so many being
                        employed in the <orgName>Hejaz railway</orgName> construction, do not concur
                        to allay such apprehension, at a moment when local police are likely to be
                        called to a reckoning as in general more or less corrupt + inefficient.</p>

                    <p>Rejoicings and joyful manifestation <del>came now</del>
                        <add>are only coming now</add> to an end, after lasting more than two
                        months: more than <add>25 well organized</add> great meetings were held int
                        he different quarters of the<pb n="2"/> city, mostly attended by several
                        thousands demonstrators and spectators, and hundreds of speeches were
                        delivered, all condemning autocracy as despotic &amp; tyrannical and
                        eulogizing liberty and constitutional government. About £2000 were spent on
                        the festivities and had not notables of <placeName>Damascus</placeName> with
                        the <orgName>young Turks</orgName> lately recommended their cessation they
                        might have continued for another month or more. It is to be remarked with
                        pleasure that all these gathering &amp; demonstrations were conducted most
                        orderly without any dispute or ill feeling among those who assembled.</p>
                    <p>Many corrupt officials were either dismissed or withdrew themselves.</p>
                    <p>The Alaybey of Gendarmerie, the Chief of Police, the Muhassebeji, six
                        Caimacams of Cazas, <persName>Moh.d P. Adm</persName> of <orgName>Idara
                            Mejliss</orgName> with about 30 other minor officials vacated their
                        posts, mostly to the general satisfaction of the public and it is debated
                        now among ‘<orgName>Young Turkey</orgName>’ adherents whether it would be
                        right to punish the officials who were led to bribery by the littleness of
                        their pay &amp; its frequent irregularity. Doubtless the proper course will
                        be followed in leaving this matter to the jurisdiction <pb/> of Parliament
                        when it assembles, and the ignorious[?] dismissal of the more corrupt,
                        rapacious &amp; outrageous among officials suffices for the moment.
                        Moreover, the vacancies are not being easily filled up by really good
                        substitutes, for such persons are at present rare, and often unwilling to
                        serve. </p>
                    <p>Damascus Clubs &amp; associations, besides the <orgName>Union &amp;
                            Progress</orgName> number now five viz <orgName>Hurriyet</orgName>,
                            <orgName>Ulema</orgName>, <orgName>Medical</orgName>,
                            <orgName>Commercial</orgName>, <orgName>Free Ottoman</orgName> besides a
                            <orgName>Shoemaker</orgName> guild. the first two are showing much
                        activity wh.[ich] is likely to excite mutation . The misapprehension &amp;
                        with uncalled solicitude <orgName>Ulema</orgName> are anxious to
                            <sic>comcure</sic> &amp; uphold Islam against the liberal views of the
                            <orgName>Young Turks</orgName>, while the latter have no intention at
                        present to interfere with religious precepts. The first point of dispute was
                        about women’s wear which the Ulema wanted to be cut on a very simple mode,
                        one piece enveloping the whole body, and the liberals denied them the right
                        of interfering with this matter which should be regarded as pertaining to
                        individual free choice. In this campaign the Ulema were defeated but not
                        without their rivals using threats of applying force.</p>
                    <p>There is little record as to practical work effected [?] by other clubs
                        though their moral influence cannot be other than good.</p>
                    <pb/>
                    <p>The Parliamentary elections are under preparation the last two months and in
                        some cazas the voters have already voted for the electors, but in
                            <placeName>Damascus</placeName> city this process will begin in a week’s
                        time. It is not even announced yet how many deputies will represent this
                        Vilayet in the Parliament but it is supposed that they will be seven or
                        eight. The <placeName>Hauran</placeName> people still reject their privilege
                        to elect a deputy and the efforts of the government in dissuading them from
                        this self-inflicted loss seem to be futile. The Mutessarif of
                            <placeName>Kerak</placeName> lately resigned on grounds of health, but
                        before doing so had been able to set going a local society or club for
                        instruction of the people of his district who indeed are little less
                        backward &amp;ignorant than this of <placeName>Hauran</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>The reforms in the various departments of the government proceed slowly. The
                            <orgName>Municipality</orgName> suppressed most improperly awarded
                        pensions paid to persons doing nothing for it and succeeded in amassing
                        about £3000 through various economies. The <orgName>Public Instruction
                            Department</orgName> formed a new chamber to consider the reorganization
                        of the educational system in this Vilayet. In the departments no special
                        reforms worth mentioning have been introduced but many are being talked of
                        &amp; discussed. </p>
                    <p>The political exiles who had been releases or rehabilitated included many
                        persons of rank, both military and civil. <persName>Mushir Fuad
                            Pasha</persName>’s release was the occasion of great demonstrations in
                            <placeName>Damascus</placeName>, but the rehabilitation of others, with
                        a few exceptions, was not publicly noticed, for this disgraces persons were
                        always enjoying personal freedom <pb/> and a very few persons knew that they
                        were ‘Ikamet Mamours’ [iqāma maʾmūr]. The chief names among these were,
                            <persName>Nouri P.</persName> Ferik of Cavalry, another Ferik called
                            <persName>Nouri Pasha</persName> sent to live here without duties,
                            <persName>Ferik Ibrahim Pasha</persName> (those three Feriks kept for
                            <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>), <persName>Ferik Lt. Osman
                            P.</persName>, <persName>Liva Behjet Pasha</persName> (those two died
                        recently), <persName>Colonel Bedri Bey</persName> (now of <persName>Liva
                            Bedri P.</persName> in <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>). The
                        Maàriz Mushiri [?] &amp; his assistant, and many minor officials or private
                        persons; such as members of the <persName>Bedr Khan</persName> family,
                        numbering more than a hundred. Further as reported in <ref>desp. No.
                            32</ref>, the Ismailians subjected to religious persecution were
                        pardoned. Happily no sort of disorder or riotous intention was displayed
                        here for the purpose of releasing prisoners and ordinary criminals
                        generally, as took place in some other places.”</p>
                    <p>Ḥijāz railway was completed in seven years and inaugurated on 1 Sep 1908.
                        four of the five battalions employed for earthworks on the line were allowed
                        to return to their garrisons. </p>
                    <p>“about 1400 of these battalions on expiry of service were disbanded.
                        Moreover, the four battalions of the <orgName>40th Reg</orgName>, sent to
                            <placeName>Medina</placeName> from this Army Corps in <date>June
                            last</date>, to guard the line, are also ordered back to their
                        headquarters. At present only two battalions are to be kept there to take
                        care of the line as regards repairs &amp; protection.” No aspirations to
                        commence construction beyond Medina due to increasing Bedouin raids
                        <pb/></p>
                    <p>“Public security in the Vilayet has been during the quarter satisfactory and
                        order was properly kept. The Bedouins have been quiet &amp; peaceful during
                        the summer, and only on two or three occasions made petty rais &amp; drove
                        or carried away animals or goods but the spoils were restored to their
                        owners without great difficulties.” Druze and Bedouins seem under the spell
                        of the government and calmly wait for the implementation of the promised
                        reforms</p>
                    <p>“the crops this year were in general very good and the grain harvest in most
                        of the districts of the Province was exceptionally abundant. The apricot
                        produce was above the average while walnuts were much below. All prices of
                        fruit and cereals are still high and the peasants this year will do well. An
                        exception might be mentioned as <pb/> as regards locusts which made a
                        perceptible damage in the <placeName><placeName>Kalamoun</placeName>
                            district</placeName> but had a very slight effect in some other Cazas.
                        But the loss to the Vilayet in general has been small.</p>
                    <p>As respects trade, no special remarks need be made; strikes at
                            <placeName>Beirut</placeName> at the Customs and on local railways have
                        produced only exiguous loss here. With reference to the latter we may note
                        that public opinion judges that the smaller employés were underpaid, while
                        the profits of the Company &amp; of its directors were considerable and the
                        public at the same time ill served.</p>
                    <p>Public health has been satisfactory on the whole this summer, but the
                            <placeName>Ain Fijeh</placeName> water has not been received the general
                        approbation anticipated which is to be regretted, as theres is absolute
                        proof the it is the best &amp; purest spring water of al this neighbourhood.
                        Its distribution to all quarters of the city proceeds slowly.”</p>
