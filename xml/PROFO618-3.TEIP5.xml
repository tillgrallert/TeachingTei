                        context usually referred to as <hi>rūmī</hi>. Arabic newspapers usually
                        labelled this calendar as <hi>sharqī</hi>.</p>
                    <p>All solar calendars add an intercalated 366th day every fourth (and, in the
                        case of Gregorian and rūmī calendars, even-numbered) year at the end of
                        February (the last day of the old Julian calendar). The Gregorian calendar
                        suppresses this rule in centesimal years that cannot be divided by 400. This
                        difference creates a growing offset between Gregorian and Julian calendars:
                        while 1900 R was a leap year, 1900 was not, which in turn caused the
                        difference between the Gregorian calendar, on the one hand, and the
                            <hi>mālī</hi> and <hi>rūmī</hi> calendars, on the other, to grow from 12
                        to 13 days from 29 Shubāṭ (February) 1900 R / 1315 M (13 March 1900)

                    <p>Ottoman fiscal calendar: a lunosolar calendar. It is based on the Old Julian
                        calendar beginning the Year with 1 March. Introduced as fiscal calendar in
                        1676 and in the Ottoman context usually referred to as <hi>mālī</hi> and
                        sometimes, confusingly, also as <hi>rūmī</hi>. Every 33 lunar years, a
                            <hi>hijrī</hi> year would complete within a single solar <hi>mālī</hi>
                        year. In this case the counting of the <hi>mālī</hi> years skipped a year to
                        catch up with the faster <hi>hijrī</hi> calendar. Due to a printing error in
                        the coupon booklets for the consolidated debt repayment program for 1872
                        (1288 M instead of 1289 M), synchronisation of <hi>mālī</hi> and
                            <hi>hijrī</hi> years was henceforth abolished. As <hi>mālī</hi> years
                        began with 1 March, <hi>mālī</hi> leap years preceded their <hi>rūmī</hi>
                        and Gregorian counterpart (the leap year 1315 M commenced on 13 March
