                     lasting more than two months. More than twenty-five well-organized great
                     meetings were held int he different quarters of the city, mostly attended by
                     several thousands demonstrators and spectators, and hundreds of speeches were
                     delivered, all condemning autocracy as despotic and tyrannical and eulogizing
                     liberty and constitutional government. About 2,000<hi rend="italic" change="#d2e98 #d2e109" xml:id="hi_1.d2e227" xml:lang="">l</hi> were

                     lately recommended their cessation they might have continued for another month
                     or more. It is to be remarked with pleasure that all these gathering and
                     demonstrations were conducted most orderly without any dispute or ill-feeling
                     among those who assembled.</p>
                  <p change="#d2e98 #d2e109" xml:id="p_7.d2e237" xml:lang="">Many corrupt officials were either dismissed or withdrew themselves. The
                     Alaibey of Gendarmerie, the Chief of Police, the Muhassebeji, the Secretary of
                     the Court of Sherá, six Kaimakams of Kazas, <persName change="#d2e98 #d2e109" xml:id="persName_6.d2e239" xml:lang="">Mohammad Pasha

                     minor officials vacated their posts mostly to the general satisfaction of the
                     public, and it is debated now among <orgName change="#d2e98 #d2e109" xml:id="orgName_3.d2e245" xml:lang="">Young Turkey</orgName> adherents
                     whether it would be right to punish the officials who were led to bribery by
                     the littleness of their pay and its frequent irregularity. Doubtless the proper
                     course will be followed in leaving this matter to the jurisdiction   of
                     Parliament when it assembles, and the ignomious dismissal of the more corrupt,
                     rapacious and outrageous among officials suffices for the moment. Moreover, the
                     vacancies are not being easily filled up by really good substitutes, for such
                     persons are at present rare, and often unwilling to serve. </p>

                     which is likely to excite emulation . The Ulema, through misapprehension, and
                     with uncalled-for solicitude, are anxious to conserve and uphold Islam against
                     the liberal views of the <orgName change="#d2e98 #d2e109" xml:id="orgName_11.d2e273" xml:lang="">Young Turks</orgName>, while the latter have
                     no intention at present to interfere with religious precepts. The first<pb n="2" facs="#facs_2" change="#d2e98" xml:id="pb_2.d2e276"/> point of dispute was about women's wear, which the Ulema wanted to
                     be cut on a very simple mode, one piece enveloping the whole body; and the
                     Liberals denied them the right of interfering with this matter, which should be
                     regarded as pertaining to individual free choice. In this campaign the Ulema
                     were defeated but not without their rivals using threats of applying force.
                     There is no record as to practical work effected by other clubs, though their
                     moral influence cannot be other than good.</p>
